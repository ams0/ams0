## A Few Things I Believe

- People are fundamentally good and thrive when given trust and opportunity
- Infrastructure should be transparent, automated, and designed for people - not the other way around
- Inclusion without exceptions builds the kind of teams where everyone grows and businesses flourish
- Diversity reflects the real world; resisting it only fuels toxic cultures
- Kubernetes is the best thing after fried chicken

## Story So Far

I wrote my first BASIC programs on a Commodore 64 shared with my brother and never stopped tinkering. By 1999 I was building Linux boxes for the Chemistry department at the University of Ferrara, fell in love with open source, and went on to publish research during my chemistry Ph.D. in Amsterdam.

That curiosity pulled me into software engineering and developer advocacy. I've built platforms and communities at Red Hat, Microsoft, and Solo.io, started [Lovelace Engineering](http://lovelace.engineering/), and today I'm back at Microsoft helping customers harness Cloud + AI while nurturing open communities as a Golden Kubestronaut.

When I'm not coaching teams, you can find me behind a bass guitar, DJ booth, or chasing the next Kubernetes experiment.
